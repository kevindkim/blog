# Hello World

Welcome to the blog! This sample post confirms the Nextra blog theme is wired correctly and that MDX content renders with syntax highlighting.

```ts
export const greet = (name: string) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};
```

> Draft posts will live under `/content/blog` before publication. Move them into `pages/blog/` once they are ready and have complete frontmatter.
